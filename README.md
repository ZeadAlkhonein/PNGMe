# PNGMe
PNGMe is a Rust project designed to explore the manipulation of PNG files. It's crafted as a self-learning tool to invite experimentation with the Rust language, showcasing multiple approachesâ€”even if some don't represent the best practices for production code.

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational purposes. It explores basic concepts and offers simple techniques for working with PNG files in Rust, intentionally including shortcuts and unconventional methods.

## Important Notes

- Use PNGMe as a learning aid to deepen your understanding of Rust programming.
- The implementations are simplified and serve as a gateway to more robust practices.
